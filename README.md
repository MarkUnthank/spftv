## Screen polarization function (Spf)

Spf is an easy-to-use, open source app written in Swift to add a semi-opaque layer over your screen in order to better show highlights and low-visiblity elements in your designs or presentations.

Have you ever been in a meeting or presentation, trying to show work or a deck on a screen or projector that just isn't calibrated well for showing things like highlights or fine-details? Hairline grays not showing up in critique? Lightweight icons practically invisible in your presentation? Highlights in imagery vanishing when presenting for an audience? Is the background wash of your design not stark enough to show card containers? Spf can help!

## How to use it

![How spf works](https://github.com/tannerc/spf/blob/master/resources/spf-demo.gif)

Just build the app in Xcode and open to run as you would any other app. You'll see a new menu icon in your status bar which then allows you to select one of several options for polarizing the currently active screen.

Once a polarizing filter has been applied, you can clear it using the same status bar menu.

## Why Spf?

While working at Facebook we had a little tool known as Preso Saver (code-name "Banana") created by my former mentor and co-founder of software company Sofa, Dirk Stoop. Once I left Facebook I found myself in meetings or presentations where the screens being presented on simply weren't calibrated or capable of showing off the fine details of my work.

Light grays or hairlines in designs were too washed-out and therefore invisible on the screen. Highlights of elements—such as composed glare or highlight states for interactive elements—were practically invisible. To help solve my problem, I re-created the Preso Saver tool from Facebook days using Swift. The tool is lightweight and remarkably simple, so much so that it only made sense to open source so others can use it and customize to better meet their needs.

Spf comes from the title "Screen polarization function", as the original concept for this tool was "Polarizer" but I wanted something a bit quirkier, Spf (pronouned "sp-iff" was the result).

Spf was created by [Tanner Christensen](https://tannerchristensen.com).
